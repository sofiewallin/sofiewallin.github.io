                    <p class="preamble">Hi! I'm Sofie Wallin and I design and code websites with the user in mind. I've been a professional web designer for 9+ years. At the moment, I'm getting a degree in web development at the Mid Sweden University to further my skills in web development.</p>
                    <p><strong>I'll be looking for work soon</strong> and on my wish list is an employer who shares my passion for the web, that can offer high technical competence and who also understand the importance of user experience. I'm above all interested in UX/UI-design, front-end development, usability and accessibility. Do you share my passions and interests? Do you think your company could be a good fit for me?  I would love to hear from you!</p>

                    <h2 class="heading big-heading">Projects</h2>
                    <p><strong>I've worked on a lot of projects</strong> as a professional web designer, graphic designer and front-end developer. However, my most recent work, that I am most proud of at the moment, are websites and applications that I've planned, designed and developed as a student at the university.</p>

                    <h2 class="heading big-heading">Skills</h2>
                    <p><strong>I always design with a purpose.</strong> My style is minimalistic, even conventional and I always start with the users point of view. In the end I want the websites I create to be usable and accessible with a clearly conveyed message. When I code I focus on the same simplicity and accessibility. In every aspect of the websites I create I want usability, whether it be in the browser or in my code base.</p>

                    <h2 class="heading big-heading">Experience</h2>
                    <p><strong>I have been a professional web designer for 9+ years</strong> but I've been making websites for much longer than that. Design have always been my main interest and I have a bachelor degree in Graphic Design and Communication. Learning to code has made it possible for me to implement my designs. As a web developer I've been primarily self taught, but as of 2020 I am studying at the university to further my skills in web development.</p>
